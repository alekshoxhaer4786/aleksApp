The provided code snippet demonstrates a TypeScript function that checks if the input is an object and, if so, checks if it has a specific property named 'key'. The function returns true if both conditions are met, and false otherwise.

The original version of the code had some inconsistencies and potential confusion due to naming conventions. Here's an improved version with better naming:

```typescript
function hasKey(obj: Record<string, any>, key: string): boolean {
  return (
    typeof obj === 'object' &&
    obj !== null &&
    key in obj
  );
}

 // Example usage: 
 const myObject = { name: "John", age: 30 }; 
 console.log(hasKey(myObject, "name")); // true 
 console.log(hasKey(myObject, "address")); // false 
} ```

 The improved version provides clearer naming conventions for better readability and maintainability. It also avoids confusion by not using the term 'meta' or 'version,' which could be misleading when dealing with actual metadata or versioning information in software development contexts.
