Okay, I need to optimize the provided code. Let me look at what's here.

First, the content_security_policy has two sections: extension_pages and sandbox. The extension_pages policy has script-src with 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval', which allows WebAssembly eval. Object-src is 'none', which blocks plugins, and frame-ancestors 'none' prevents framing. Font-src is 'self'. 

The sandbox policy allows scripts via allow-scripts, but also includes script-src with 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval'. That's a security risk because unsafe-inline and eval are bad practices as they can lead to XSS attacks. Also, default-src is none, connect-src allows all connections (using *), which might be too permissive.

Externally_connectable allows all origins (http/https) to connect to any extensions since ids are set to *. That's probably not needed unless specifically required for cross-extension communication.

Minimum Chrome version 115 seems okay if that's necessary for certain features.

Optimization steps: 

For content security policies:
- Remove unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval from sandbox script-src where possible.
- Replace inline scripts by using nonces or hashes instead.
- For externally_connectable, restrict the matches or ids if possible; maybe only specific extensions or domains.
- Consider tightening connect-src in sandbox from * to specific hosts if feasible.
- Ensure that font/src directives in both policies align correctly without redundancy.

So revised CSPs would have safer directives without those insecure options. Maybe combine similar directives across policies where applicable. Externally_connectable could be limited unless there's a reason for wildcard usage.

Putting it all together:

In extension_pages keep current setup but maybe check redundancy between font/src entries across policies.

For sandbox remove allow-scripts? Wait noâ€”sandboxing uses allow-scripts while CSP restricts it further via script src. But mixing both should be okay as long as CSP doesn't have unsafe allowances anymore.

So final optimized code would tighten up those permissions where possible without breaking functionality intended by the original settings but enhancing security posture overall by eliminating unnecessary broad permissions like wildcard connection sources or allowing eval/inline scripts unless strictly required.
